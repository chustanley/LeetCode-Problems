In ArrayStrings, what we used was....
- pointers to find out location and incremenet
- used new Set() to remove duplicates and see if theres any duplicates in other strings




- These problems used a lot of index pointers for..
  - in place replacement while iteration
  - finding duplicates
  - etc.

- Index pointers have been used within arrays, along with sets and etc to customize iteration throughout these problems.
