/*
Approach
- longest path only makes sense for direct acyclic path because no loops! only one direction.
- your goal is to return the edges!!
- to end the longest path, you have to find the terminal node which contains a value of [] / no outgoing edges

- mark terminal nodes as 0's

- depth first search probably best.

/*
Find the terminal nodes = nodes that are the end of the graph. Add them into a set.

Steps:
- Loop through an adjacency and add the terminal nodes to a set with a value of 0;
- Perform a depth first search on every node in an adjacency list.
- When we arrive at a node that we saw before, please return its value.


Explanation:
- Get terminal nodes to be 0.
- for every node we encounter on the adjacency list, we want to find its maximum longest path.
- We can do this by performing a depth first search and for every returned recursive call, we check for its maximum with a vairable.
- Final: after assigning it to a variable. we assign the value of the node the highest maximum value possible!


Be Careful:
- We need some max value logic when iterating through the neighbor of a node.
- We ARE trying to find the longest path of the nodes.

How to use max value logic:
- For every stack, we can have a count variable and say
