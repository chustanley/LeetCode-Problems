/*
Write a function, insertNode, that takes in the head of a linked list, a value, and an index.
The function should insert a new node with the value into the list at the specified index.
Consider the head of the linked list as index 0. The function should return the head of the resulting linked list.

Do this in-place.

You may assume that the input list is non-empty and the index is not greater than the length of the input list.

//Iterative Approach

  //Might look a bit confusing at first but if you think about it
  //What your doing is at the 2nd node, you are assigning the end.next which is technically the '2nd item' but not the '2nd' INDEX
  //GOAL: make the new input the '2nd index' of the LL meaning the 3rd item in this case

//Recursive Approach
const _insertNode = (head, value, index, count = 0) => {
  if (index === 0) {
    const newHead = new Node(value);

//Test Case
const a = new Node("a");
const b = new Node("b");
const c = new Node("c");
const d = new Node("d");

a.next = b;
b.next = c;
c.next = d;

// a -> b -> c -> d

insertNode(a, "x", 2);
// a -> b -> x -> c -> d
